## Amazon.nl Test Automation Framework with Playwright

This document provides a detailed description of the Playwright framework developed for testing Amazon.nl.

### Key Components

- **Playwright:** The core browser automation and testing library. It enables interaction with web pages, performing actions, and making assertions.
- **TypeScript:** Chosen for its strong typing, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer experience.
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Central design pattern. Code is organized into page objects, each representing a specific page on Amazon.nl, promoting code reusability and reducing code duplication.
- **Locators:** Playwright's locators (CSS selectors and built-in methods) are used to identify and interact with elements on the page.
- **Assertions:** Playwright's `expect` library is used for verifying the application's state and behavior.
- **Configuration:** The `playwright.config.ts` file centralizes Playwright configuration (browser settings, test directory, timeouts, reporters).
- **HTML Reporter:** Generates an HTML report of test results for analysis and sharing.

### Design Principles

- **Modularity:** Clear separation of concerns between page objects, test scenarios, and configuration.
- **Reusability:** POM structure promotes code reusability by encapsulating page-specific logic.
- **Maintainability:** Clean code, consistent naming conventions, and TypeScript contribute to maintainability.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be scalable for adding new tests and page objects as the application grows.
- **Readability:** Clear and concise code, descriptive test names, and comments enhance readability.

### Best Practices

- **Clean Code:** Meaningful names, consistent formatting.
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** POM pattern helps avoid code duplication.
- **Atomic Tests:** Test scenarios focus on specific functionalities or features.
- **CI Integration:** Easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and reporting.
- **Cross-Browser Testing:** Supports multiple browsers for compatibility testing.

This framework provides a robust, maintainable, and scalable test automation solution for Amazon.nl by adhering to these design principles and best practices.
